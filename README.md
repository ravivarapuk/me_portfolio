My portfolio site.

You might think that why does a Data Engineer need a portfolio site, that's coz i beleive that anything that you do/build on the back-end doesn't hav that much of a visibilty to a user. So, that is when i realized that i needed to have a face and to haave a face i need to know web development. So, due course of my larning and bugging other fellow web dvelopers i decided that to learn things much more preecisely why not build a portfolio website of my own.

I'm going to be as creative as i can while building this. So, lets see how it come out to be.

Very excited to be doing this. ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜€ðŸ˜„
